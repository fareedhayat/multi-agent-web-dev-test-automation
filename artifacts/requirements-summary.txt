- Real-time validation with inline messages; disable Submit until valid.
- Show loading spinner on submit; simulate success/failure (800-1500ms).
- Success: clear form, focus first field, show dismissible banner, log analytics event.
- Failure: keep inputs, focus first invalid field, show error banner with guidance.

More Information Page:
- Search input filters service cards by title/description (debounced ~250ms).
- Filters: tag chips with multi-select; combine with search.
- Sort dropdown: Alphabetical or Popularity (mock data).
- FAQ accordion: expand/collapse one at a time; persist state via localStorage.
- Tabbed content: switch between Services, Insurance, and Locations smoothly.

Shared UI/Interactions:
- Theme toggle: light/dark mode persisted in localStorage.
- Reusable toast notifications for success/error/info; auto-dismiss or manual close.
- Smooth scrolling for in-page anchors; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Lazy-load images with loading='lazy'; show skeleton loaders until ready.

Accessibility & Performance:
- WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast, focus order, skip-to-content link, ARIA roles.
- Keyboard-first: all interactive elements operable by keyboard.
- Performance: debounce search, avoid heavy libraries, minimize reflow.
- Test on mobile devices and latest browsers for responsiveness.

- SEO: meaningful titles, meta description, favicon, structured headings.
- Placeholder content clearly marked; no real personal data stored/sent.

Analytics:

- Track actions: form_submit_success, form_submit_error, search, filter_change, theme_toggle.
- Hidden debug panel toggled via keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+D) to view events.

Acceptance Tests:
- Navbar is sticky, highlights active page, back-to-top appears after scroll.

- More Info: search filters cards, filters/sort work together, accordion persists state, tabs switch views, skeleton loaders replaced.
- Accessibility: Tab cycles logically; ARIA attributes on accordion and tabs.

Success Criteria:
