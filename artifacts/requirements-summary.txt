Interactive Healthcare Website

Pages & Navigation:
- Home page: hero section with intro and CTA buttons linking to other pages.
- More Information page: services overview with interactive components.
- Contact Us page: form with client-side validation and feedback.
- Sticky navbar: highlights active page, includes 'Back to top' button after scroll.
- Smooth scrolling for in-page anchors; respects reduced motion.

Contact Us Form:
- Fields: Full Name (required), Email (required, valid format), Phone (optional, auto-format), Message (required, 20-1000 chars).
- Real-time validation: inline messages; disable Submit until valid.
- Submission UX: loading spinner, simulate success/failure (800-1500ms), show toast notification.
- Success: clear form, focus first field, show dismissible success banner, log analytics event.
- Failure: keep inputs, focus first invalid field, show error banner with guidance.
- Accessibility: proper labels, ARIA aria-invalid, keyboard navigation, clear focus styles.

More Information Page:
- Search: filters service cards by title/description; debounced at ~250ms.
- Filters: tag chips (multi-select) combined with search.
- Sort: dropdown to sort cards by Alphabetical or Popularity (mock data).
- FAQ accordion: expand/collapse answers; one open at a time; persist state via localStorage.
- Tabbed content: switch between Services, Insurance, and Locations with smooth transitions.
- Optional map embed: highlight map marker on location card click (client-side only).

Shared UI/Interactions:
- Theme toggle: light/dark mode persisted in localStorage.
- Toast notifications: reusable component; auto-dismiss with manual close.
- Lazy-load images with loading='lazy'; skeleton loaders for cards until ready.

Accessibility & Performance:
- WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast, focus order, skip-to-content link, ARIA roles.
- Keyboard-first: all interactive elements operable via keyboard.
- Performance: debounce search, minimize reflow, avoid heavy libraries.
- Test on mobile: mobile-first responsive layout (320px+).

Non-Functional Requirements:
- SEO: meaningful titles, meta description, favicon, structured heading hierarchy.
- Content: placeholder copy/images; no real personal data stored or sent.
- Mobile-first responsive layout; test on Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari.

Analytics:
- Log events to window.analyticsLog with { type, timestamp, payload }.
- Track actions: form_submit_success, form_submit_error, search, filter_change, theme_toggle.
- Hidden debug panel: toggle via keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+D) to view recent events.

Acceptance Tests (Playwright):
- Navbar: sticky, highlights active page, 'Back to top' appears after scroll.
- Theme toggle: persists across refresh, respects reduced motion.
- Contact form: validation messages, disabled submit when invalid, success clears inputs, failure focuses first invalid field.
- More Info: search filters cards, filters/sort work together, accordion persists state, tabs switch views, skeleton loaders replaced.
- Accessibility: Tab cycles logically, ARIA attributes on accordion and tabs.

Success Criteria:
- All acceptance tests pass.
- No console errors in latest browsers.
- Lighthouse performance and accessibility scores ≥ 90 on desktop.
