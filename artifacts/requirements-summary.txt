- Home page: hero section with intro and CTA buttons linking to other pages.
- More Information page: services overview with interactive components.
- Contact Us page: form with client-side validation and feedback.

- Smooth scrolling for in-page anchors; respects reduced motion settings.

Contact Us Form:

- Submission UX: loading spinner on submit; simulate success/failure (800-1500ms).
- Success: clear form, focus first field, show dismissible banner, log analytics event.
- Failure: keep inputs, focus first invalid field, show error banner with guidance.
- Accessibility: labels, ARIA aria-invalid, keyboard navigation, clear focus styles.

More Information Page:
- Search: client-side input filters service cards by title/description (debounced ~250ms).
- Filters: tag chips (multi-select) combined with search functionality.
- Sort: dropdown to sort cards by Alphabetical or Popularity (mock data).
- FAQ accordion: expand/collapse answers; one open at a time; persist state via localStorage.

Shared UI/Interactions:
- Theme toggle: light/dark mode persisted in localStorage.
- Toast notifications: reusable component for success/error/info; auto-dismiss with manual close.
- Lazy-load images with loading='lazy'; use skeleton loaders until content is ready.

Accessibility & Performance:
- WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast, focus order, skip-to-content link, ARIA roles.
- Keyboard-first: all interactive elements operable by keyboard.
