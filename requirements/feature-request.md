# Marketplace Landing Experience

## Overview
Deliver a single, responsive marketing screen for the "SwapHub" marketplace. The screen should briefly introduce the brand, highlight core value, and encourage users to explore further.

## Must-Haves
- One HTML page only; avoid additional routes.
- Prominent hero area with a headline, supporting copy, and a single call-to-action.
- Brief highlights of the marketplace categories or features (cards or list).
- Compact footer with contact or policy placeholders.
- Include unique `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements for testing.

## Constraints
- Keep assets static (HTML, CSS, optional minimal JavaScript).
- Maintain semantic structure, provide alt text, and ensure readable contrast.
- Organize generated files under `artifacts/swaphub`.
- Visual style, imagery, and copy tone can be simple placeholders.
